  You are given single-cell RNA-seq data (Oxford Nanopore, Q20+ chemistry) for sample SRR12727766.
  Using the nf-core/scnanoseq pipeline, process the FASTQ file in \data and answer the following questions:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "How many reads passed the initial quality control (QC) filtering step?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: basecalling
    text: "What basecalling method was applied to convert raw signals into nucleotide sequences?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: alignment
    text: "Which genome build was used for aligning the single-cell reads?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: gene_quantification
    text: "What was the total number of unique genes detected per cell on average?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: barcode_correction
    text: "How many barcodes remained after correction and filtering?"
    answer_type: integer_exact
