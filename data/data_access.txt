-------------------------

The dataset used in this project corresponds to single-cell RNA-seq data generated using Oxford Nanopore technology. The data is publicly available under the SRA accession ID:

    SRR12727766

To access the data manually, follow these steps:

1. Visit the NCBI SRA page for the dataset:
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR12727766

2. Click on the "Send to:" dropdown, select "File", then choose "FASTQ" format.

3. Alternatively, you can download the FASTQ files using the SRA Toolkit with the following command:

   ```bash
   fastq-dump --gzip --split-files SRR12727766
   ```

4. Once downloaded, move the resulting FASTQ files into the `\data` folder of your project structure to be compatible with the provided pipeline.

Note: Due to file size constraints, only a subset of this dataset may be uploaded for use in Taiga or GitHub. If the full dataset is not included, please refer to this instruction and re-download using the steps above.
